		<h1>Welcome! We believe your being here entails you are a University of the People student.</h1>
		<h2>And that you are aware of an idea being proposed by a body of students at UoPeople.</h2>
	</div>

	<p>If not, here is the what of the proposal</p>

	<div id="dvi-two">
		<p id="the-proposal">
			On behalf of a representative portion of the student body of the University of the People, we are initiating this petition to be endorsed and forwarded as a proposal to the authorities concerned, of our noble institution. We are proposing, that in addition to the current envelops in which degrees are mailed, that a degree scroll containing the award, be also made available.  
			<br>
			<br>
			In support of the advancing  and developing character of the University of the People, we thought that it would be an improvement on the official reflection and accredited status of the University of the People , as well as a sense of satisfaction amd accomplishment for students, especially in the absence of a graduation. 
			<br>
			<br>
			This scroll option being made available students to receive their awarded degrees in, as a UoPeople graduate, is an expansion on the choices, scroll instead of the traditional envelops only. We are not asking that the envelops be eliminated, as not everyone will be able to afford the scrolls. What we are asking for is an increase in and an expansion of the number of options. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Our graduation is an extremely important moment which concludes years of efforts and sacrifices, and overcoming many challenges. Thus, an official presentation of of our awards, will in some way, suffice, until graduations can be arranged in the future. We believe that a nicer package that reflects the accredited and official status of the university, the official and academic status of the award, as well the provision of a competitive edge for the graduates, as they enter a new and advancing stage of their professional development and career pathway. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Please endorse this petition as we seek to advance our Alma Mater, which has done so much to  enhance and enrich our personal and professional lives.
			<br>
			<br>
			Please note that this premium package would attract an extra fee, but is not compulsory. The traditional envelop option would be still available at the standard university set fee. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Your support in this matter is greatly appreciated
